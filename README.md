# 426_Project

## Introduction
This repository contains a tutorial on how to interact with datetime and timedelta objects in Python.

Personal Project.ipynb - the tutorial on how to interact with datetime and timedelta objects. It uses a partially cleaned dataset from an annual 5K/10K race held in Utah. We are interested in cleaning "chip_time","pace", and "gun_time", while creating a new feature "diff_time". "chip_time" is the time registered when a racer has crossed the starting line, "gun_time" is when the gun went off to officially start the race, and "pace" is the rate in minutes per mile which a participant runs. "diff_time" will be a new feature created to show the difference between when the initial gun went off and when the participant crossed the starting line.

project_data.csv - contains all the data we need to convert datetime and timedelta objects. All of the other features are irrelevant to the point of this project aside from the 4 features aforementioned.
